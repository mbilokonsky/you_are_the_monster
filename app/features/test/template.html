  <h3>Angular Feature: test</h3>
  <p>This template is working as expected. It was created by using the following command in the project root:</p>
  <pre>lineman grunt addFeature:test</pre>
  <p>As you can see, app/features/test was created, which includes behavior.js, template.html, style.less and spec.js all stubbed out and ready for use.</p>
