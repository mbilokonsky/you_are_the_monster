<div class='introduction well'>
  <p>Hello. You've been tasked by the devil to generate as much misery on earth as possible. Given that you are the CEO of an enormous global commerce organization, this should be a reasonably straightforward challenge. You must:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Maximize global misery</li>
      <li>while keeping your company out of bankruptcy</li>
      <li>and keeping your employees from rising up and killing you.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To achieve these ends, you will of course have full access to the company's financials and HR records, as well as economic forecasts and customer satisfaction surveys. Some things to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your employees will quit if their morale gets too low (though they are willing to put up with more suffering if the economy is bad enough)</li>
      <li>Employee misery is different from employee morale - due to a manufacturing defect in human psychology, you can sometimes increase morale by increasing misery.</li>
      <li>Your customers are your best friends - they provide the dollars that keep you afloat, they generate misery when their desires aren't met, and they provide the complaints that can justify unfathomably brutal workplace practices.</li>
      <li>Pay attention to the economy - and if you get a chance, do everything you can to tank it!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Gameplay will proceed in turns, where each turn represents one week. A lot can happen in a week!</p>

    <p>Are you ready? Let's <button ui-sref='game'>begin!</button></p>
